Goodnight Julia, you bodacious babe you. We had a pretty rad day. Running with scizors, changing the smoke detector batteries, finding the back plate to my Tamagotchi, sorting my light bright collection, kicking vampire kittens in the streets, stealing from EA, creating an uprising to protect net neautrality, playing through Xenoblade for the 12th time, buying a new box of french toast crunch (part of a complete breakfast), calling my freshman biology teacher a "fat, corrupted, hoe-bag", legally changing my name to Jefferson Steelflex, and sorted the mail.
